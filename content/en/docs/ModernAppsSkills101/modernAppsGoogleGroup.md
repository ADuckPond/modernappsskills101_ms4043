The ModernApps Ninja google group serves as the communities primary email distribution list, used primarily to send updates about new courses, learning content and events. Optionally you may view the video at the bottom of this page for a walk through of the signup process and group overview.

We regularly add users who have signed up to the https://modernapps.ninja platform to the google group, however this process is not yet automated and there can sometimes be delays between modernapps ninja registration and being added to the google group.

Please check https://groups.google.com and check the "My Groups" section to see if you are already a member of the group. If you are not yet a member of the group, please request to join the group at the link: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/modernappsninja/join

After you request to join the group, your application must be approved before you are able to access the group details. We try to approve joint requests promptly, however it may take up to a few days for us to approve your join request.

For more detail, you can optionally view the video below for a walk through of the signup process and group overview.
